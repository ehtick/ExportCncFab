# ExportCncFab

Revit .NET API add-in to export Revit wall parts to DXF or SAT for CNC fabrication.

For more information, please refer to
[The Building Coder](http://thebuildingcoder.typepad.com) and the 12-minute
[Revit to CNC Direct YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNJ9RTppqoU).

## No Executable

**Question:** I have customer enquiring about a DXF exporting add-in for Revit that you created.
I there a way to access the tool for exporting to CNC?

**Answer:** I created that sample add-in for Revit API demonstration purposes only.
For all information on it, please refer to
the [GitHub ExportCncFab repository](https://github.com/jeremytammik/ExportCncFab) and
the blog posts that it points to.
For legal reasons, I cannot publish executable applications, only source code.
Therefore, your customer or you yourself are free to grab the source code from GitHub and create the required add-in from that.
I hope this helps.
Please let me know what you think and how you get on with this.
